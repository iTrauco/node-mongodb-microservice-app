# node-mongodb-microservice-app
This repo contains one of my eariest attempts to create a microservice application w/ NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB during my time at DigitalCrafts. Due to the time intensity of the DigitalCrafts program, this app was left in an unfinished state and has since been archived. 

The MongoDB admin credentials contained in this repo's code are no longer valid; no security risk exists, the raw code of this formerly 'Private' repo has been intentionally left 'intact.'
